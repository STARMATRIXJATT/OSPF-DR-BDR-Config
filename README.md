# OSPF-DR-BDR-Config
This repository contains OSPF DR/BDR election configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer.
ðŸš€ Mastering OSPF DR/BDR Election in Cisco Packet Tracer! ðŸš€

I recently worked on setting up OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) with Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) in a multi-router topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.

ðŸ”¹ Why DR/BDR?
In OSPF, when multiple routers are connected to the same network, a DR and BDR are elected to reduce routing overhead and improve efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Key Configurations:
âœ… Set OSPF Priority to control DR/BDR election:

interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip ospf priority 255  # Higher priority = DR
âœ… Verify OSPF Neighbors:

show ip ospf neighbor
âœ… Ensuring Efficient Routing in Multi-Access Networks

ðŸ“Œ This hands-on practice strengthened my understanding of dynamic routing, network convergence, and OSPF operations.

ðŸ’¡ Looking forward to more networking projects and discussions! If you're working on CCNA, OSPF, or Cisco networking, letâ€™s connect! ðŸ”—
